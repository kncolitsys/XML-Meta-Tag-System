Simple Coldfusion + XML Meta Tag System

Its now simple to manage your pages with this system. All you need is two files, meta.cfm (or meta-script.cfm) and meta.xml

Meta.cfm needs to be included in your <head> section or the code copied into your header etc.

Meta.xml can be placed anywhere, but remember to change the mapping variable in the meta.cfm file.
